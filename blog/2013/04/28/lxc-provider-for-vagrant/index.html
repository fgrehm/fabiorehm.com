and <a href=https://groups.google.com/d/topic/vagrant-up/fp3UfclJDg8/discussion>announced</a> on
Vagrant&rsquo;s mailing list that I was going to work on this. By that time, Vagrant 1.1 wasn&rsquo;t
even released yet and it was a <a href=https://github.com/fgrehm/vagrant-lxc/contributors>long</a>
<a href=http://rubygems.org/gems/vagrant-lxc/versions>way</a> to get where it is now.</p><p>Almost two weeks after &ldquo;releasing&rdquo; the spike, Vagrant 1.1 <a href=http://www.hashicorp.com/blog/vagrant-1-1-and-vmware.html>came out</a>
and by then someone <a href=https://twitter.com/fgrehm/status/312340609350385664>challenged</a>
people to write a LXC <a href=http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/providers/index.html>provider</a>
for it. I felt great since I was already using <a href=https://github.com/fgrehm/vagrant-lxc>vagrant-lxc</a>
over the past couple weeks :)</p><p>For those who have never heard about <a href=http://lxc.sourceforge.net/>LXC</a>
, it is <em>&ldquo;the userspace control package for Linux Containers, a lightweight
virtual system mechanism sometimes described as &lsquo;chroot on steroids&rsquo;&rdquo;</em>.
As a &ldquo;real world&rdquo; example, it is the technology that powers Heroku&rsquo;s <a href=https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/dynos#technologies>Dynos</a>
and probably a whole lot of <a href=http://blog.dotcloud.com/paas-under-the-hood-ebook>other PaaS providers</a>.</p><p>Below you&rsquo;ll be able to watch a video / screencast that demonstrates the plugin
on its current state.</p><p>Alright, that last bit was cool hey? I&rsquo;m not sure exactly how I&rsquo;ll explore that

for root privileges not even once. The reason behind it is that all the time I
was on a vagrant box which by definition requires passwordless <code>sudo</code> to be <a href=http://docs-v1.vagrantup.com/v1/docs/base_boxes.html>enabled</a>.</li><li>When compressing boxes <code>tar</code> might throw up some <a href=https://github.com/fgrehm/vagrant-lxc/issues/46>warnings</a>

Rails projects with great success. Before that I was a VirtualBox user and so
far LXC has proven not only to perform better but to be more stable (at least
for my work).</p><p>My primary goal with this was to have a lightweight alternative for VirtualBox
for Linux users and after <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food>eating my own dog food</a>
for the last 2 months I believe I was able to achieve that. <a href=https://twitter.com/fgrehm/status/313746305195323392>I do see it being pushed</a>
to its limits and I already know about people going further and using it for
continous integration but I don&rsquo;t see it being my main focus for the short term
(more on this below). From what I&rsquo;ve read it looks like some people have struggled
to use lxc and vagrant-lxc attempts to make it a no brainer.</p><p>I&rsquo;m not saying that &ldquo;VirtualBox is dead&rdquo; neither that LXC is perfect. There are
also other proven virtualization technologies take into consideration too (like
<a href=http://libvirt.org/>libvirt</a> or <a href=http://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Main_Page>KVM</a>
for example). For instance, I still use VBox to <a href=https://github.com/fgrehm/vagrant-lxc/wiki/Development#using-virtualbox-for-development>try out new things while developing the provider</a>
and there will be times that you&rsquo;ll need to have a full blown VM (like when you
need to test your web apps on IE :)</p><h2 id=performance>Performance

that things are &ldquo;faster&rdquo;. I&rsquo;ll save the benchmark to another post but one thing
I can say for sure: bringing a vagrant-lxc container up from scratch and reloading
it is a lot faster (no double quotes here).</p><p>On my machine, it takes around <code>01:31</code> to bring a clean Ubuntu 12.10 VBox VM up
from scratch and <code>00:40</code> to reload it, with vagrant-lxc those numbers go down to
<code>00:30</code> and <code>00:12</code> respectively, that alone is a HUGE win. If you have done any
Puppet or Chef development using Vagrant for a long time you have probably spent a
fair bit of time recreating / restarting machines to try things out and a lxc
container can potentially save you from a lot of waiting time.</p><p>Another cool thing about using containers is that they <a href=http://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/LXC#Container-based_Virtualization_.28lxc.29>share</a>
your host&rsquo;s Kernel and resources. I&rsquo;m not a 100% sure but I believe that at least
in theory it means you&rsquo;d achieve the same performance as if you were running things
directly on your physical machine. You <em>can</em> limit the amount of memory and CPU
cores / shares the containers will get by configuring <a href=http://en.gentoo-wiki.com/wiki/LXC#Control_Groups>Control Groups</a>
but by default it will allow using everything you&rsquo;ve got.</p><p>On a site note, if you need to run <a href=https://github.com/guard/guard>Guard</a> on the
guest machine it will simply work. There&rsquo;s no need to <a href=https://github.com/guard/listen/issues/53>enable pooling</a>
neither you need to <a href=/blog/2013/01/17/100-percent-on-vagrant/#enable_nfs>enable NFS shared folders</a>
to have a reasonable performance.</p><h2 id=stability>Stability

last year). I began using it back in 2009 when I used to be a frustrated Windows
user trying to learn Ruby on Rails. After consecutive failed attempts to get things
working within Windows and not switching to Linux I had to rely on a VM to work.
I ended up spending a lot of my time inside the VM and one of the main reasons
that made me &ldquo;promote&rdquo; Linux to my main OS was that VBox was crashing and acting
weird quite a lot.</p><p>After switching to Linux I started using VirtualBox as my own little &ldquo;playground&rdquo;.
Whenever I wanted to try out some new stuff that could potentially mess up with
my host OS or had lots of dependencies I&rsquo;d do it there. In my experience, the
amount of crashes / issues I had reduced dramatically but were still present.</p><p>So far my experience with LXC has been awesome, I haven&rsquo;t experienced any crash
at all during normal usage. The only problem I had so far was a <a href=https://github.com/fgrehm/vagrant-lxc#help-im-unable-to-restart-containers><em>buggy</em> Kernel</a>
and a hard time trying to boot nested containers as I&rsquo;ve done on the video.</p><h2 id=usage-on-os-x--windows>Usage on OS X / Windows

not work on OS X nor Windows hosts. But you can still benefit from it!</p><p>As I said the time taken to recreate containers is lower than what you&rsquo;ll get with
VirtualBox so you can use it to get a faster feedback about Puppet manifests / Chef
cookbooks even though your physical machine can&rsquo;t create containers. Right now you
are thinking: &ldquo;but dude, I&rsquo;m on a mac / windows! how will I use this?&rdquo;. Well, if
you watched the video you&rsquo;ll probably remember that the &ldquo;box stack&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve shown
has a VBox container between my laptop and the other containers. My laptop has
Ubuntu 12.10 installed but you could easily replace it with a Windows or
OS X machine (and why not use it from a EC2 instance managed by <a href=https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant-aws>vagrant-aws</a>
;)</p><p>With the proper Vagrant setup, you can make it a trivial process. Imagine you
have this Vagrantfile:</p><p>When you run:</p><pre><code>[host] $ vagrant up vbox
[host] $ vagrant ssh vbox

[vbox] $ vagrant plugin install vagrant-lxc
[vbox] $ cd /vagrant
[vbox] $ vagrant box add quantal64 http://dl.dropbox.com/u/13510779/lxc-quantal-amd64-2013-04-21.box
[vbox] $ vagrant up lxc --provider=lxc
</code></pre><p>You&rsquo;ll end up with a container ready to rock. Because of the way the ports
are being forwarded, you could potentially be able to hit an Apache instance
running on the container on port <code>80</code> directly by going to http://localhost:3001
in your browser. You might as well set up the container to automatically start
when the VBox machine goes up to save you some trouble.</p><p>Before you alt-tab to try it out, please keep in mind that on its current
state it won&rsquo;t work out of the box but I believe that it wouldn&rsquo;t be hard to automate
that process and <a href=https://github.com/fgrehm/vagrant-lxc/issues/23>I do have plans</a>
to make it a no brainer as well.

vagrant-lxc</a>. I keep hearing
people talk a lot about it but I only got to play with it for a couple days. As I
commented on this <a href=https://github.com/dotcloud/docker/issues/404#issuecomment-16697703>GitHub issue</a>,
I actually don&rsquo;t think a Docker provider would be a &ldquo;competitor&rdquo; to the pure lxc
implementation, my goal is to have it as a replacement to VirtualBox for
Linux users. On the other hand: <em>&ldquo;Docker complements LXC with a high-level API
which operates at the process level. It runs unix processes with strong guarantees
of isolation and repeatability across servers&rdquo;</em>.</p><p>Given what I know so far, my initial impression is that the Docker provider would
be something like an &ldquo;advanced vagrant-lxc&rdquo;, don&rsquo;t know&mldr; To be honest, I neither
played with Docker enough nor I have a deep knowledge around linux containers
itself to understand if that actually makes sense, but at least is one less
dependency for users to install ;)</p><h2 id=ok-so-whats-next>Ok, so what&rsquo;s next?

main focus will now shift to write documentation and to improve the current
codebase. I&rsquo;ve started working on this even before there was any official Vagrant
1.1 documentation (remember that I had a somewhat working version even before 1.1
got released?) and the internal design has not changed that much since then. There
is a lot of improvements that can be made to the codebase in order to take the
project to the &ldquo;next level&rdquo;. I also have a lot of homework to do and I want to
dig deeper into LXC itself before pushing more functionality into the plugin.</p><p>We definitely need more base boxes to increase adoption, so far I <a href=https://github.com/fgrehm/vagrant-lxc#available-boxes>released 3
versions of Ubuntu</a> and I&rsquo;ve
just received a <a href=https://github.com/fgrehm/vagrant-lxc/pull/65>pull request</a>
with the scripts to build Debian base boxes. I personally only use Ubuntu
boxes so feel free to contribute with scripts to build base boxes for other
distros (documentation about building base boxes are <a href=https://github.com/fgrehm/vagrant-lxc/issues/67>on the way</a>).</p><p>As I wrote above, <code>redir</code> is something that I don&rsquo;t want to depend on and I&rsquo;d love
to know better alternatives for it. I also need to think about a way of properly
exposing forwarded guest containers&rsquo; port to the outer world. This is <em>probably</em>
the next functionality that might get into the plugin.</p><p>There is also a few <a href="https://github.com/fgrehm/vagrant-lxc/issues?labels=core&page=1&state=open">core features missing</a>,
some extra functionality <a href="https://github.com/fgrehm/vagrant-lxc/issues?labels=enhancement&page=1&state=open">planned</a>
and some known <a href="https://github.com/fgrehm/vagrant-lxc/issues?labels=bug&page=1&state=open">bugs</a>
to be fixed. I&rsquo;m not sure in what order I&rsquo;m going to tackle those guys yet but
feel free to sign up to fix / implement any of them or report bugs as you find
them. Any kind of help will be greatly appreaciated here since I&rsquo;ve been doing
this pretty much all by myself so far.</p><h2 id=summing-up>Summing up

Feel free to reach
me in case you need any help. I tried to write my current feelings about all this
and after some thought I chose to end this post by just quoting <a href=http://www.hashicorp.com/blog/preview-vagrant-aws.html>HashiCorp</a>
which perfectly maps to my current thinking:</p><blockquote><p>I’m very excited for the opportunities and use cases this unlocks, as well as the
potential to dramatically improve end-to-end productivity and testability of your
work environments.</p></blockquote><p><em>A special thanks goes to those that reviewed the initial version of the video and
somehow contributed to this post.
