The name was originally proposed by Patrick Connolly and after seeing the pictures he pointed out (just forget about the first row ;) I thought that it&amp;rsquo;d fit nicely with a vagrant :)
Please note that you&amp;rsquo;ll need to uninstall and revert Vundler&amp;rsquo;s installation before upgrading to Bindler.</description></item><item><title>Vundler: Dead easy plugin management for Vagrant</title><link>https://fabiorehm.com/blog/2013/07/15/vundler-dead-easy-plugin-management-for-vagrant/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jul 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fabiorehm.com/blog/2013/07/15/vundler-dead-easy-plugin-management-for-vagrant/</guid><description>UPDATE (23 JUL 2013): Vundler has been renamed to Bindler!
Vagrant&amp;rsquo;s plugin &amp;ldquo;ecossystem&amp;rdquo; just keep growing and recently there has been a lot of interest on having an easy way for managing project&amp;rsquo;s specific plugin dependencies to avoid Dependency Hell and / or to reduce the amount of steps someone has to take when joining an ongoing project. There are at least 4 issues on Vagrant&amp;rsquo;s issue tracker (#1874, #1789, #1700 and #1574) and one initiative by @tknerr to solve the problem.</description></item></channel></rss>
