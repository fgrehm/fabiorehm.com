To give you an idea, this is what I&amp;rsquo;ve released over the year:
vagrant-notify - Released at the end of 2012, but &amp;ldquo;matured&amp;rdquo; by beginning of 2013 vagrant-boxen (deprecated) - February 17th vagrant-lxc - March 12th vagrant-cachier - May 22nd vagrant-pristine (deprecated) - July 11th bindler - (deprecated) Public release on July 15th as Vundler and later renamed to Bindler vagrant-global-status (deprecated) - August 8th vocker (deprecated) - August 14th ventriloquist (deprecated) - September 10th docker-provider (deprecated) - November 5th Before you think I&amp;rsquo;m going nuts, I have a reason behind releasing each plugin and I might blog about that someday but for the scope of this post I&amp;rsquo;ll focus on what you should expect for each one of them over 2014.</description></item><item><title>Ventriloquist demo</title><link>https://fabiorehm.com/blog/2013/10/13/ventriloquist-demo/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Oct 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fabiorehm.com/blog/2013/10/13/ventriloquist-demo/</guid><description>A while ago I stumbled across this benchmark by Brandon Liu on StackMachine&amp;rsquo;s blog comparing the numbers for performing some typical tasks on his physical machine and doing the same thing using virtual machines.
The measurements were made using Discourse and compared the numbers of doing things on VirtualBox and VMware Fusion so I got curious to see how well vagrant-lxc shared folders would perform. What I ended up finding is that it seems that Discourse provides a base box that was configured by hand and the Chef cookbooks used only deal with some basic stuff and I&amp;rsquo;d have to either do things by hand or write some provisioning scripts on my own.</description></item></channel></rss>
