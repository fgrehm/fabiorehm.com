I wrote it to draw my attention to a terminal when some long command finishes running.
WTF?!? Yeah, it may sound silly but how often do you run a command that you know that takes a lot of time to complete, you go do something else and forget that the command was running? Even worse, what about when you get side tracked for a bit longer than you should and when you Alt+Tab to check if the command has finished it actually errored along the way?</description></item></channel></rss>
