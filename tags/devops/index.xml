The initial configuration was not so straightforward to me so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d write it down in case I need to do it again. The information on this post is probably documented somewhere but I failed to find it, feel free to comment with links to official docs or other blog posts related :)</description></item><item><title>Announcing Ventriloquist</title><link>https://fabiorehm.com/blog/2013/09/11/announcing-ventriloquist/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Sep 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fabiorehm.com/blog/2013/09/11/announcing-ventriloquist/</guid><description>Although I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing about and working on a lot of Vagrant related stuff lately, I need to say that I&amp;rsquo;m not a &amp;ldquo;DevOps guy&amp;rdquo;. My day to day job still consists of building web apps using Ruby On Rails and even though I like using Puppet (and recently Chef), my daily work does not involve any sort of machine configuration management.
Configuring a Vagrant development environment is not an easy task.</description></item></channel></rss>
