In short, by using a COW + union file system Docker makes things really cheap when it comes to disk usage.
The idea of COW filesystems along with a couple GitHub issues, some tweets exchanged with @rcarmo and this post on improvements made on lxc-clone was enough to trigger my interest on BTRFS and I went out to learn more about it.</description></item></channel></rss>
