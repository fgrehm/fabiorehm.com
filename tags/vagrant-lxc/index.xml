To give you an idea, this is what I&amp;rsquo;ve released over the year:
vagrant-notify - Released at the end of 2012, but &amp;ldquo;matured&amp;rdquo; by beginning of 2013 vagrant-boxen (deprecated) - February 17th vagrant-lxc - March 12th vagrant-cachier - May 22nd vagrant-pristine (deprecated) - July 11th bindler - (deprecated) Public release on July 15th as Vundler and later renamed to Bindler vagrant-global-status (deprecated) - August 8th vocker (deprecated) - August 14th ventriloquist (deprecated) - September 10th docker-provider (deprecated) - November 5th Before you think I&amp;rsquo;m going nuts, I have a reason behind releasing each plugin and I might blog about that someday but for the scope of this post I&amp;rsquo;ll focus on what you should expect for each one of them over 2014.</description></item><item><title>vagrant-lxc 0.5.0 and beyond</title><link>https://fabiorehm.com/blog/2013/08/07/vagrant-lxc-0-5-0-and-beyond/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Aug 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fabiorehm.com/blog/2013/08/07/vagrant-lxc-0-5-0-and-beyond/</guid><description>Last week I was able to release vagrant-lxc 0.5.0 and on this post you&amp;rsquo;ll get to know about some cool new stuff and the upcoming work I have in mind to reach what I believe would be a nice 1.0.0 milestone.
0.5.0 goodies This release it mostly related to the &amp;ldquo;user experience&amp;rdquo; of using the plugin. Apart from some highlights you&amp;rsquo;ll get to know below, there are a few small things that makes people&amp;rsquo;s lives a bit easier:</description></item><item><title>Crafting your own vagrant-lxc base box</title><link>https://fabiorehm.com/blog/2013/07/18/crafting-your-own-vagrant-lxc-base-box/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Jul 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fabiorehm.com/blog/2013/07/18/crafting-your-own-vagrant-lxc-base-box/</guid><description>As I said before, &amp;ldquo;next generation&amp;rdquo; vagrant-lxc boxes should simplify the process of &amp;ldquo;promoting&amp;rdquo; existing containers to base boxes. To back that up I&amp;rsquo;ve wrote a detailed step-by-step for creating an Ubuntu Precise and Debian Squeeze base boxes from an Ubuntu Host and I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure it is possible to reuse the ideas from this post to build base boxes for / from other distros that suits everyone&amp;rsquo;s needs.
I&amp;rsquo;ve followed the steps on an Ubuntu 12.</description></item><item><title>Improving vagrant-lxc boxes</title><link>https://fabiorehm.com/blog/2013/06/10/improving-vagrant-lxc-boxes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jun 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fabiorehm.com/blog/2013/06/10/improving-vagrant-lxc-boxes/</guid><description>So I&amp;rsquo;ve played with Docker once again and have been looking around its codebase to find out how things work over there. Even though I&amp;rsquo;ve never wrote a single line of Go, it gave me some interesting insights about LXC itself and about packing up containers which influenced heavily the &amp;ldquo;next generation&amp;rdquo; vagrant-lxc base boxes and the upcoming work I have in mind for the provider.
Starting with V3 boxes, vagrant-lxc will introduce a better approach for building base boxes and will also simplify the process of &amp;ldquo;promoting&amp;rdquo; existing containers to base vagrant boxes.</description></item></channel></rss>
