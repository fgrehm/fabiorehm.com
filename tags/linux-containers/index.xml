To back that up I&amp;rsquo;ve wrote a detailed step-by-step for creating an Ubuntu Precise and Debian Squeeze base boxes from an Ubuntu Host and I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure it is possible to reuse the ideas from this post to build base boxes for / from other distros that suits everyone&amp;rsquo;s needs.
I&amp;rsquo;ve followed the steps on an Ubuntu 12.</description></item><item><title>Improving vagrant-lxc boxes</title><link>https://fabiorehm.com/blog/2013/06/10/improving-vagrant-lxc-boxes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jun 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fabiorehm.com/blog/2013/06/10/improving-vagrant-lxc-boxes/</guid><description>So I&amp;rsquo;ve played with Docker once again and have been looking around its codebase to find out how things work over there. Even though I&amp;rsquo;ve never wrote a single line of Go, it gave me some interesting insights about LXC itself and about packing up containers which influenced heavily the &amp;ldquo;next generation&amp;rdquo; vagrant-lxc base boxes and the upcoming work I have in mind for the provider.
Starting with V3 boxes, vagrant-lxc will introduce a better approach for building base boxes and will also simplify the process of &amp;ldquo;promoting&amp;rdquo; existing containers to base vagrant boxes.</description></item><item><title>LXC provider for Vagrant</title><link>https://fabiorehm.com/blog/2013/04/28/lxc-provider-for-vagrant/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fabiorehm.com/blog/2013/04/28/lxc-provider-for-vagrant/</guid><description>UPDATE: This post is likely to be out of date, please see this post for more
It&amp;rsquo;s been nearly 2 months since I open sourced my &amp;ldquo;not so pretty&amp;rdquo; initial spike and announced on Vagrant&amp;rsquo;s mailing list that I was going to work on this. By that time, Vagrant 1.1 wasn&amp;rsquo;t even released yet and it was a long way to get where it is now.
Almost two weeks after &amp;ldquo;releasing&amp;rdquo; the spike, Vagrant 1.</description></item></channel></rss>
