Useful for forwarding notifications from local VMs / Containers to your own computer. It even supports notification icons!
Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 only
Why? Because I do all of my dev work on virtualized environments and I use guard quite a lot to keep my Ruby tests running when files get changed.</description></item><item><title>Devstep updates</title><link>https://fabiorehm.com/blog/2014/09/25/devstep-updates/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Sep 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fabiorehm.com/blog/2014/09/25/devstep-updates/</guid><description>The third release of the Devstep Docker image came out last night along with a brand new Golang CLI featuring some very nice improvements and new functionality. The CHANGELOG is here and on this post I&amp;rsquo;ll cover some exciting new stuff I was able to get in place.
Docker image updates Starting with the base image updates, the 0.2.0 release dropped from 1.168GB down to 867.7MB MB representing a ~25% reduction on disk usage.</description></item></channel></rss>
