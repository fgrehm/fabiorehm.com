To give you an idea, this is what I&amp;rsquo;ve released over the year:
vagrant-notify - Released at the end of 2012, but &amp;ldquo;matured&amp;rdquo; by beginning of 2013 vagrant-boxen (deprecated) - February 17th vagrant-lxc - March 12th vagrant-cachier - May 22nd vagrant-pristine (deprecated) - July 11th bindler - (deprecated) Public release on July 15th as Vundler and later renamed to Bindler vagrant-global-status (deprecated) - August 8th vocker (deprecated) - August 14th ventriloquist (deprecated) - September 10th docker-provider (deprecated) - November 5th Before you think I&amp;rsquo;m going nuts, I have a reason behind releasing each plugin and I might blog about that someday but for the scope of this post I&amp;rsquo;ll focus on what you should expect for each one of them over 2014.</description></item><item><title>Vundler is now Bindler!</title><link>https://fabiorehm.com/blog/2013/07/23/vundler-is-now-bindler/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jul 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fabiorehm.com/blog/2013/07/23/vundler-is-now-bindler/</guid><description>Quick update about Vundler: lots of people got confused about the plugin name because of Vim&amp;rsquo;s Vundle so we decided to rename it to Bindler. The name was originally proposed by Patrick Connolly and after seeing the pictures he pointed out (just forget about the first row ;) I thought that it&amp;rsquo;d fit nicely with a vagrant :)
Please note that you&amp;rsquo;ll need to uninstall and revert Vundler&amp;rsquo;s installation before upgrading to Bindler.</description></item></channel></rss>
