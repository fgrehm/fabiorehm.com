## Quick Access

- **"Does this sound like me?"** → Read `voice-markers.md`
- **"Is this authentic or generic?"** → Read `authenticity-patterns.md`
- **"How should I handle technical details?"** → Read `technical-writing.md`

## How to Use This

**Before editing any content:**
1. Re-read one of the voice reference posts (listed in voice-markers.md)
2. Check: Does this sound like 2017 Fabio or like a tutorial?
3. If it feels too structured/polished, it probably is

**When drafting structure:**
1. Start with conversation about topic and angle
2. Suggest minimal structure (headers + bullet notes)
3. Let Fabio write the meat
4. Don't fill in content sections

**When Fabio asks for "cleanup":**
1. Fix typos, grammar, flow
2. Don't restructure or add sections
3. Don't sanitize casual language
4. Ask: "Does this still sound like you?"
