# Fabio Rehm's Writing Style Guide

_Extracted from analyzing 15+ blog posts (2013-2017) and refined through 2025 comeback posts_

## Writing Voice & Tone

**Conversational and Personal**
- Write in first-person ("I've been", "my experience", "I need to say")
- Keep tone conversational, like talking to a friend or colleague
- Use self-deprecating humor and honest admissions of limitations
- Focus on actual personal use cases rather than generic examples
- Don't shy away from stronger expressions: "complete pain in the ass", "took me forever"
- Use "stuff" instead of overly formal language when appropriate
- **Avoid English idioms** that may confuse non-native speakers - use direct language instead of phrases like "voting with my wallet"

**Technical but Accessible**
- Explain complex technical concepts in approachable language
- Balance technical depth with readability
- Use analogies to clarify concepts
- Always provide practical, runnable examples

**Honest and Transparent**
- Admit when things don't work or when uncertain
- Share failures alongside successes
- Be upfront about limitations and drawbacks
- Admit when you haven't used something extensively
- Avoid overstating adoption level - "cautious experimenter" not "advocate"

## Post Structure Patterns

### Opening Approaches
1. **Problem Statement**: Start by identifying a pain point or need
2. **Context Setting**: Provide background about situation or experience
3. **Tool/Project Introduction**: Directly introduce what you're announcing

### Common Section Headers
- "Why bother?" / "Why do I think..." (motivation)
- "How does it work?" (mechanics)
- "What's next?" / "Future work" (future plans)
- "Performance" (metrics when relevant)
- "Worth mentioning limitations" (honest about drawbacks)
- "That's it!" / "Summing up" (conclusion)

### Signature Language
- Use casual abbreviations: "IMHO", "TBH", "AFAIK", "YMMV"
- Transitional phrases: "That said...", "To be really honest..."
- Call-to-action style: "Feel free to reach me if you need help or want to talk more about this"

## Content Guidelines

### External References
- Link generously to related projects, docs, other developers
- Credit other people's work and contributions
- Reference GitHub issues, PRs, and commits
- **Strategic linking for SEO**: Include relevant outbound links to authoritative sources
- Use reference-style links format: `[text][ref]` with references at bottom

### Technical Details
- Include implementation details for experienced developers
- Discuss architecture decisions and trade-offs
- Provide concrete numbers for performance claims
- Break down complex processes into numbered steps

### Authenticity Markers
- Share real usage scenarios from work
- Discuss time constraints and practical limitations
- Show project evolution over time
- Acknowledge collaborators and reviewers
