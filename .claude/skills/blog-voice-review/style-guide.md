# Fabio Rehm's Writing Style Guide

_Extracted from analyzing 15+ blog posts (2013-2017) and refined through 2025 comeback posts_

## Writing Voice & Tone

**Conversational and Personal**
- Write in first-person ("I've been", "my experience", "I need to say")
- Keep tone conversational, like talking to a friend or colleague
- Use self-deprecating humor and honest admissions of limitations
- Focus on actual personal use cases rather than generic examples
- Don't shy away from stronger expressions: "complete pain in the ass", "took me forever"
- Use "stuff" instead of overly formal language when appropriate
- **Balance casual tone with precision**: Be conversational about feelings/process, precise about facts/timelines
  - Good: "for over 3 years" (precise)
  - Too casual: "for like 3+yrs" (hurts credibility)
- **Avoid English idioms** that may confuse non-native speakers - use direct language instead of phrases like "voting with my wallet"

**Technical but Accessible**
- Explain complex technical concepts in approachable language
- Balance technical depth with readability
- Use analogies to clarify concepts
- Always provide practical, runnable examples

**Honest and Transparent**
- Admit when things don't work or when uncertain
- Share failures alongside successes
- Be upfront about limitations and drawbacks
- Admit when you haven't used something extensively
- Avoid overstating adoption level - "cautious experimenter" not "advocate"

## Post Structure Patterns

### Opening Approaches
1. **Problem Statement**: Start by identifying a pain point or need
2. **Context Setting**: Provide background about situation or experience
3. **Tool/Project Introduction**: Directly introduce what you're announcing

### Common Section Headers
- "Why bother?" / "Why do I think..." (motivation)
- "How does it work?" (mechanics)
- "What's next?" / "Future work" (future plans)
- "Performance" (metrics when relevant)
- "Worth mentioning limitations" (honest about drawbacks)
- "That's it!" / "Summing up" (conclusion)

### Living Document Notes
- State upfront when content will evolve: "This is a living document/series"
- Set expectations for updates: "I'll update as I discover new patterns, gotchas, and solutions"
- Positions posts as authentic ongoing learning vs one-time definitive guides

### Series Index Posts
- Start with personal context (why you're doing this)
- "Who This Is For" section with positive + negative criteria
- Each part gets: description + **key takeaway** in bold
- Technical stack overview with links
- "The Bottom Line" with honest tradeoffs (What you gain / What you deal with)

### Signature Language
- Use casual abbreviations: "IMHO", "TBH", "AFAIK", "YMMV"
- Transitional phrases: "That said...", "To be really honest..."
- Call-to-action style: "Feel free to reach me if you need help or want to talk more about this"

## Content Guidelines

### External References
- Link generously to related projects, docs, other developers
- Credit other people's work and contributions
- Reference GitHub issues, PRs, and commits
- **Strategic linking for SEO**: Include relevant outbound links to authoritative sources
- Use reference-style links format: `[text][ref]` with references at bottom

### Technical Details
- Include implementation details for experienced developers
- Discuss architecture decisions and trade-offs
- Provide concrete numbers for performance claims
- Break down complex processes into numbered steps
- Add inline notes for potential gotchas: "Platform compatibility note:", "Permission gotcha:"
- Clarify assumptions that might not be obvious
- Preempt common confusions with brief callouts

### Acronyms and Jargon
- Common abbreviations (IMHO, TBH, YMMV) - use freely
- Technical acronyms your audience knows - use without explanation
- Slang/casual acronyms (GSD, RTFM) - link to explanation or spell out
- When in doubt: assume international, non-native English audience

### Authenticity Markers
- Share real usage scenarios from work
- Discuss time constraints and practical limitations
- Show project evolution over time
- Acknowledge collaborators and reviewers
- Frame work as "scratching my own itch" - personal problem-solving, not generic tutorials
- Connect current work to 10+ year patterns/journey when applicable
- Be honest about experimentation stage - "after a week of trying X" not "now using X daily" unless truly established

### Presentation Patterns
- Tradeoffs: Use **bold headings** ("What you gain:" / "What you deal with:") over emoji/checkmarks for accessibility and professionalism
- External links: Include links to docs, community resources, and related posts for SEO and credibility
- Stack overviews: Link to official resources (docs, homepages) alongside descriptions
