# Authenticity Patterns & Credibility Signals

_Extracted from style-guide.md - Markers that prove genuine personal experience_

## Authenticity Markers

**Personal disclaimers upfront:**
- "I need to say that I'm not an DevOps guy"
- "I'm not 100% sure but I believe..."
- "While I'm somewhat comfortable with X, my daily work..."
- Disclaim expertise - this builds trust, not undermines it

**Iterative project narrative:**
- Be upfront about previous attempts: "this is my third attempt at building a tool"
- Reference failed/evolved earlier approaches: "being vagrant-boxen and ventriloquist the other two"
- Show the journey: "Since then the idea has evolved..."
- Don't present projects as perfect first attempts

**Ongoing experience markers:**
- Share real usage scenarios from work
- Discuss time constraints and practical limitations
- Show project evolution over time
- Acknowledge collaborators and reviewers
- Frame work as "scratching my own itch" - personal problem-solving, not generic tutorials
- Connect current work to 10+ year patterns/journey when applicable
- Be honest about experimentation stage - "after a week of trying X" not "now using X daily" unless truly established

**Inline updates when things change:**
- Use strikethrough for outdated info: `<s>old approach</s>`
- Add `_**UPDATE**:` right there in context, not hidden at end
- Shows evolution of thinking transparently
