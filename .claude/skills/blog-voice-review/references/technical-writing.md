# Technical Writing Guidelines

_Extracted from style-guide.md - External references, technical precision, and jargon usage_

## External References & Technical Details

**Strategic linking:**
- Link generously to related projects, docs, other developers
- Credit other people's work and contributions
- Reference GitHub issues, PRs, and commits
- Include relevant outbound links to authoritative sources
- Use reference-style links format: `[text][ref]` with references at bottom

**Technical precision:**
- Include implementation details for experienced developers
- Discuss architecture decisions and trade-offs
- Provide concrete numbers for performance claims
- Break down complex processes into numbered steps
- Add inline notes for potential gotchas: "Platform compatibility note:", "Permission gotcha:"
- Clarify assumptions that might not be obvious

**Acronyms and jargon:**
- Common abbreviations (IMHO, TBH, YMMV, AFAIK) - use freely
- Technical acronyms your audience knows - use without explanation
- Slang/casual acronyms (GSD, RTFM) - link to explanation or spell out
- When in doubt: assume international, non-native English audience
