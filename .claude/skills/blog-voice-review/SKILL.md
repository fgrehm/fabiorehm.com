# Voice & Tone Review

## Quick Checks
- First person? ("I've been", "my experience")
- Conversational? (like talking to a colleague)
- Honest about limitations?
- Personal experience vs generic advice?
- Any English idioms that confuse non-native speakers?

## Red Flags
- Overly formal language
- Generic examples ("Let's say you have...")
- Claims without personal context
- Marketing speak
- Phrases like "leverage", "utilize" instead of "use"

## Style Guide
For detailed voice guidelines, see `style-guide.md`

## Process
1. Read the content
2. Flag issues with brief explanation
3. Don't rewrite - let author fix in their voice

## Response Format
Keep it conversational:

```
This section feels generic - you mention "users might want" but where's YOUR experience? 

Also caught an idiom: "hit the ground running" might confuse non-native speakers. Try more direct language.

The technical explanation is great though - clear and accessible.
```
