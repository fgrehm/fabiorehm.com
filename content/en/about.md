Hi, I'm Fabio! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer based in Brazil. I've been writing code professionally since the early 2010s, working with various technologies over the years - from PHP and .NET to Ruby on Rails, with some DevOps work, Go, and even some legacy VB6 thrown in the mix. These days I'm focused primarily on Ruby on Rails development.

## What I Do

I build Ruby on Rails applications and I'm currently exploring how AI tools can improve developer productivity.

In the past, I created developer tools and contributed to open source projects. I contributed to [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) itself, and built tools like [vagrant-lxc](https://github.com/fgrehm/vagrant-lxc), [vagrant-cachier](https://github.com/fgrehm/vagrant-cachier), [devstep](https://github.com/fgrehm/devstep), and [letter_opener_web](https://github.com/fgrehm/letter_opener_web), but haven't done much open source work recently because life happened. Most of these are now archived as the ecosystem moved on.

I started this blog in 2013 to share solutions to problems I encountered while developing. After an 8-year break (2017-2025), I'm trying to get back to writing about current development challenges and tools.

## Get in Touch

Feel free to reach out if you have questions about anything I've written, want to collaborate on a project, or just want to chat about development tools and practices.
