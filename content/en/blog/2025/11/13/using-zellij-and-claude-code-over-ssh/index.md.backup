TODO(@fabio/@claude): When publishing this post, make these cross-link updates:

- Update series index at `/blog/2025/11/11/modernizing-my-terminal-based-dev-environment/` to add link to this post in Part 2 section
- Update DevPod post at `/blog/2025/11/11/devpod-ssh-devcontainers/` to uncomment the cross-link at top (currently lines 17-20) and fix the path from `/drafts/terminal-based-development-workflow/` to this post's final path
- Fix all `/drafts/` references in this file (lines 27, 263) to use correct `/blog/YYYY/MM/DD/` paths once posts are published

```

**Note:** This post covers the daily terminal workflow experience. For the DevPod setup and SSH devcontainer configuration, see the companion post: [DevPod: SSH-Based Devcontainers Without IDE Lock-in](/blog/2025/11/11/devpod-ssh-devcontainers/).

## The Setup

I switched to SSH-based development using DevPod for devcontainers (see [DevPod post](/blog/2025/11/11/devpod-ssh-devcontainers/) for the devcontainer setup). This post is about what daily development actually feels like with this workflow.

**The stack:**

- **SSH into containers** - DevPod gives me SSH access to devcontainers
- **Zellij** - Terminal multiplexer (tabs, panes, persistent sessions)
- **Neovim** - Editor (LazyVim config)
- **Claude Code** - AI coding assistant (CLI, not GUI)
- **Oh My Zsh** - Shell with custom prompt

This is the terminal-based alternative to Cursor/VSCode. Same devcontainer, different interface.

## The Daily Workflow

```bash
# From host terminal
bin/dpod up      # 8.7 seconds to start devcontainer

# SSH in
bin/dpod ssh

# Inside container (zsh with custom prompt)
🐳 devpod ➜ web-3 git:(main)

# Start zellij session
zellij attach my-app --create

# Start Rails in one tab
bin/dev          # Rails on localhost:3000

# New zellij tab (Ctrl+T N)
# Run tests, Claude Code, whatever
```

**What works great:**

- [ ] Copy/paste images into Claude Code (this failed in Cursor's terminal!)
- [ ] Shift+click links in zellij (e.g., Claude auth URLs open in browser)
- [ ] Full nvim setup with LazyVim
- [ ] Claude Code running inside container
- [ ] Tests, migrations, everything just works

## Zellij: The Good and the Gotchas

Zellij is a [terminal multiplexer](https://typecraft.dev/tutorial/zellij-vs-tmux) - a tool that lets you run multiple terminal sessions inside a single window with tabs and panes. If you're new to the concept, the linked guide provides a solid introduction.

### The Good

**Visual tabs and panes:** Zellij shows status bar with tabs, makes it obvious what's running where.

**Persistent sessions:** Sessions survive SSH disconnects. Reattach and everything's still there.

**Shift+click links:** URLs in terminal output are clickable. Claude Code auth links just work.

### The Gotchas

**Accidental quit (Ctrl+Q):**

Hit `Ctrl+Q` and zellij closes. Sometimes `zellij attach` recovers your session - restoring tabs and prompting to resume running commands. Other times you're hunting for the process in `htop`. The recovery feature exists but feels unreliable.

**Lesson learned:** Use named sessions (`zellij attach project-name --create`). Makes recovery explicit instead of hoping zellij remembers.

**Keyboard shortcut conflicts:**

Zellij intercepts shortcuts needed by Claude Code and nvim:

- `Ctrl+T` - zellij new tab (blocks Claude Code)
- `Ctrl+O` - zellij pane navigation (blocks Claude Code)
- Workaround: `Ctrl+G` locks zellij, passes shortcuts through
- Problem: `Ctrl+G` is also nvim's edit prompt trigger

**Better solution:** Remap zellij to use `Alt` as the main modifier instead of `Ctrl`. This avoids conflicts with both Claude Code and nvim keybindings. Some terminal users [report](https://haseebmajid.dev/posts/2024-12-18-part-7-zellij-as-part-of-your-development-workflow/) better results with Alt-based keybindings since Alt rarely clashes with other tools.

Terminal multiplexers add shortcut complexity. You'll lock/unlock accidentally, hit the wrong binding, and occasionally lose work. VSCode/Cursor don't have this friction.

### Session Management

**Always use named sessions:**

```bash
# Good - explicitly named
zellij attach my-app --create

# Bad - anonymous session
zellij
```

Named sessions make it obvious what you're attaching to. When you accidentally quit, you know what to recover. Anonymous sessions feel like gambling.

**List running sessions:**

```bash
zellij list-sessions
```

If you're not sure what's running, check before creating a new session.

## Claude Code in the Terminal

Running Claude Code via CLI instead of GUI has tradeoffs.

**What works:**

- Copy/paste images directly (failed in Cursor's integrated terminal)
- Full terminal integration (Claude runs where your code runs)
- No context switching between IDE and terminal

**What's different:**

- Keyboard shortcuts conflict with zellij (need lock mode)
- No GUI for browsing chat history (terminal-only interface)
- Need to remember CLI flags instead of clicking buttons

**Honest take:** The CLI feels faster for quick questions, but the GUI is better for reviewing long conversations. I miss being able to scroll through history visually.

## Neovim: LSP and SSH

**What I'm testing:**

- LSP performance over SSH with large Ruby/TypeScript codebases
- Whether there's noticeable lag compared to native editing
- How reliable autocomplete/diagnostics feel

**So far:** It works. Haven't hit any obvious lag yet, but I'm only a week in. Will update after more daily use.

**LazyVim config:**

- Lives in `../../devpod-data/nvim/` (persists across container recreations)
- Project-specific plugins (e.g., Slim syntax for Rails)
- Shared config across all DevPod workspaces

## The Honest Friction Points

### 1. Shortcut Gymnastics

IDE users press `Ctrl+T` and get what they expect. I press `Ctrl+T` and zellij intercepts it. I press `Ctrl+G` to lock zellij. Now Claude Code gets `Ctrl+T`. But wait, `Ctrl+G` also triggers nvim's edit prompt.

You learn the dance. But it's a dance.

### 2. Session Recovery Uncertainty

When zellij crashes or I accidentally quit, sometimes recovery works perfectly. Sometimes it doesn't. I don't know why. IDE users close their editor and everything's exactly where they left it.

### 3. Manual Configuration

Every tool needs configuration:

- Zellij config for keybindings
- Neovim config for LSP/plugins
- Shell config for aliases/prompt
- Git config for signing

IDE users install an extension and it just works. I write setup scripts and debug when they break.

### 4. Git Signing Quirks

DevPod's SSH wrapper can break git commit signing. The fix (removing `gpg.ssh.program` on shell startup) usually works, but sometimes the wrapper reappears mid-session. When commits fail with cryptic signature errors, you debug git config instead of writing code.

IDE users' git integration just works. Terminal users troubleshoot with `git cat-file commit HEAD` to verify signatures.

### 5. Port Forwarding Noise

~~Harmless but loud on disconnect:~~

```
error Error port forwarding 3000: accept tcp 127.0.0.1:3000: use of closed network connection
```

**Update:** These errors seem to have stopped appearing. Keeping this here in case they return, but may have been a transient configuration issue.

## Why Do This At All?

**Control:** I configure everything. I understand what's happening under the hood.

**Speed:** SSH into container, start zellij, get to work. 8.7 seconds total. No GUI loading time.

**Flexibility:** Want to try a different multiplexer? Install it. Different shell? Configure it. Different editor? Use it. Not locked into an IDE's worldview.

**Worktrees:** Multiple branches running simultaneously with dedicated ports/databases. See [git worktrees post](/drafts/git-worktrees-docker-parallel-development/) for details.

**Learning:** Solving these friction points teaches you more about terminals, shells, and SSH than clicking buttons in an IDE ever would.

## Would I Recommend This?

**If you're already terminal-based:** Yes. You're used to the friction. You value the control. This gives you SSH-based devcontainers without forcing you into an IDE.

**If you're learning terminal tools:** Maybe. You'll learn a lot. You'll also fight with shortcuts, lose sessions occasionally, and wonder why you didn't just use VSCode.

**If you're happy with VSCode/Cursor:** No. Stay there. The IDE integration works well. This isn't an upgrade for you - it's a lateral move with different tradeoffs.

## The Tradeoff

**IDE users get:**

- Zero friction
- Automatic setup
- GUI for everything
- Consistent shortcuts
- Reliable state persistence

**Terminal users get:**

- Manual configuration
- Understanding of the stack
- Flexibility to change tools
- SSH-based workflow
- Occasional friction

Neither is necessarily better. It's a preference.

## What I'm Still Figuring Out

**Clipboard integration:** Currently relying on terminal emulator's clipboard. OSC 52 might make copy/paste from container to host smoother.

**Zellij keybinding customization:** Can I remap conflicting shortcuts? Haven't tried yet.

**Session backup/restore:** Zellij has `Ctrl+O` then tab to resurrect recently closed sessions, but it feels unreliable. Sometimes it works perfectly, sometimes it doesn't. Need to investigate if there are settings to make resurrection more consistent.

**Claude Code auth persistence:** Have to re-authenticate after container recreate even though `~/.claude` is mounted. Need to debug where tokens are stored and if it's a permissions issue.

**Dotfiles consolidation:** Currently using [basic dotfiles](https://github.com/fgrehm/dotfiles-devcontainer/blob/main/install.sh) for DevPod. Want to merge with my main dotfiles setup.

Terminal-based development with SSH, multiplexers, and CLI tools works. It also has friction that IDE users never deal with.

After a week of daily use, the friction is acceptable. The shortcut conflicts are annoying but learnable. The session recovery uncertainty is frustrating but rare. The manual configuration is time-consuming but educational.

Is it better than VSCode/Cursor? No. It's different. It trades IDE convenience for terminal flexibility. Whether that's worth it depends entirely on what you value.

For me: I'm sticking with it. The control and understanding are worth the friction.

# NOTES TO REVIEW AND INCORPORATE

- Shift click to open links in zellij
- Clipboard integration would be amazing, specially for pasting images into claude chat
- Get a basic layout with server on one tab, another tab with claude on the right + nvim on the left
- CTRL+L to clear / reset for reals? If not, maybe Alt+L?
- Remap keybindings for alt
- https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim/discussions/1344
- Weird, clipboard is working fine today :confused:
